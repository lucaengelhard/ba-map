# Bachelorproject Map Interface

This Repo contains the code for part of my bachelor project [@HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd](https://www.hfg-gmuend.de/). Me and my prject partener developed an exhibition concept that include a projection on a topographical map. The projection and interaction logic was coded in Typescript with the help of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [flubber](https://github.com/veltman/flubber), and [SVGR](https://github.com/gregberge/svgr).
